# PZ_Optimization

Class overrides for Project Zomboid Build 42 (Java, LWJGL/OpenGL) that improve chunk
streaming and driving frame time, plus a hands-off benchmark harness that measures them.
Public repo (xD3I/PZ_Optimization). Maintainer: the repository owner (they/them).

## Requirement: overrides behave like the jar except where we edited them (2026-09-23)

Every method of `src/overrides/` that carries no `// pzopt:` edit must compile to the same behaviour as the
game jar. `scripts/bytecode-audit.py` checks it (compiler-neutral fingerprint of each unedited method against
`build/stock/`) and **`scripts/build.sh` fails when it does not pass**. Vineflower mis-renders compile fine
and shipped to players: the parking-lot loop that spawned one row of cars per chunk plus `case 5 -> 2` for
the High car-spawn rate (Workshop "cars barely spawn", 2026-09-23), a float divide for the jar's double one
(`FishSchoolManager`), a dropped cast that made `CanSee` call itself (2026-09-22). Therefore:

- A mismatch is a decompiler bug: fix `src/overrides` to match the jar's `javap -c` (CFR in `decompiled/`
  helps), mark the fixed lines `// pzopt: decompiler fix ...`, note it in `docs/override-edits.md`.
- An intended edit needs its `// pzopt:` marker on every changed line (the audit skips a method that has one);
  an unmarked edit fails the build.
- `scripts/bytecode-audit.allow` is only for differences read by hand and proven not to change what the
  method computes (compound-assignment re-reads, constant inlining), each with its reason.
- After `scripts/regen-overrides.sh` / a game update, the audit is the check that the new decompile is sound.
- When a player reports gameplay that differs from vanilla, audit the classes involved first.

## Objective (stated 2026-09-18)

"Consistent frame time if the CPU and GPU utilization allows it; the CPU and GPU should
always be used to the max if the framerate is not smoothly pegged at 240 fps."
Every benchmark report must show frame-tail metrics (p99 / p99.9 / spikes / jitter) AND
utilization (CPU/GPU load from sysmon) over the route window. "fps < 240 and hardware not
saturated" is itself a finding. Chunk-latency wins are done; do not spend more on the streamer.

## Hard rules

- **`decompiled/` stays local** (gitignored, 24 MB CFR output of the whole jar). Never `git add`
  it. `src/overrides/` (the 25 shadowed classes with our `// pzopt:` edits) IS committed since
  2026-09-19: the maintainer confirmed the sources may ship. Every edit is still described in prose in
  `docs/override-edits.md`, and the `// pzopt:` markers stay on every changed line.
- **Shared machine.** Several Claude sessions and the maintainer use the one game install and `~/Zomboid`.
  Before a launch or a reinstall check both `pgrep -f '[P]rojectZomboid64'` and
  `pgrep -f '[h]arness/run.sh'` (excluding your own). Message busy peers (ListAgents /
  SendMessage) before reinstalling or starting a batch. See `.claude/skills/bench-run`.
  **Preferred since 2026-09-21: submit through the run queue** (`harness/queue.sh submit run|mp|workshop|cmd
  [--machine desktop|flip|dell|mac] ... -- <args>`, `harness/CLAUDE.md` "Run queue"): one worker per machine
  runs its jobs in the order Jev picks (2026-09-22 evening: every submit carries `--intent`, `--progress`, and `--name` once per session; a run also `--resource` and optionally `--bench <name>|auto` from `harness/queue/benches.json`, Jev suggests the bench for the intent; Jev weighs them with waits, session age and the size estimate; `next` shows the plan; job start = desktop notification; a job past its estimate sends an `overrun:` event), waits for a game or run.sh outside the queue, routes laptop jobs over a monitored ssh
  connection, keeps a session on the machine it first used, notifies sessions (`watch`, `events`) when a
  machine drops or a job ends, and writes each job's `result.txt` with Jev's verdict; `--wait` blocks on it.
  No pgrep dance, no peer messages, no hand-rolled ssh wrappers for a run.
- **Runs go without Steam** (maintainer, 2026-09-24, repeated 2026-10-07): every run launches with
  `--launcher direct` unless it needs Steam (a Proton run, a Steam-overlay / Steam-input check). Since 2026-10-07
  `queue.sh submit run` adds `--launcher direct` when the args carry no `--launcher`; pass `--launcher steam` to ask for
  Steam. run.sh's own default is still `auto` (Steam whenever the client is logged on), so a direct `run.sh` call or a
  `submit cmd` wrapper must pass `--launcher direct` itself. A Steam launch loaded no overrides on 2026-10-06 (0 `[pzopt]`
  console lines): check `grep -c '\[pzopt\]' console.txt` > 0.
- **Run etiquette.** The maintainer is usually at the machine. Say a run is about to start before
  launching, one run at a time, never long batches. Never edit `harness/run.sh` while a run is in
  progress (bash reads it incrementally; a mid-edit launch died and its EXIT trap corrupted
  `latestSave.ini`). Launch from a copy (`harness/.run-snapshot.sh`) if someone else edits it.
- **Never kill with a self-matching pattern.** `pkill -f '<pattern>'` where the pattern appears in
  your own command line kills the tool shell (exit 144). Use bracket patterns like
  `[P]rojectZomboid64` or a saved PID.
- **All recordings and videos are AV1 HDR.** Every `--record` capture (gpu-screen-recorder
  `-k av1_hdr`: AV1 10-bit PQ / BT.2020) and every video published under `docs/media/` (the
  stitch scripts, `harness/encode-av1-hdr.sh`, the `-1080` README copies) is encoded AV1 10-bit
  with PQ / BT.2020 tags; never tone-map to SDR H.264. SDR sources are mapped to PQ; posters and
  GIFs are the only tone-mapped derivatives. See `harness/CLAUDE.md`.
- **Real saves are never loaded or written** by a harness run. Runs use the copied bench save
  `Saves/Sandbox/pzopt-bench` and must quit on their own. Launching the game via
  `harness/run.sh` is authorized without asking.
- **Verify every Louisville run before using its numbers** (maintainer, 2026-09-22). About one
  `--preset louisville` run in three flips into a broken state a few seconds after world-ready. Cause: the
  preset's `see_all` flag turns on the lighting engine's B41 spectator path, which spreads NaN light values,
  so the roofs flicker and our lighting re-bakes flood (fps halves, pale blue-grey blotches on the black roofs).
  It is a preset artefact (stock B42 never takes that path) and is left as is. So:
  1. Always pass `--record`.
  2. Before reading anything, check the frames of the settle window (world-ready → route start, before the
     measured route begins) for visual artifacts. `schedule.log` says `world ready N s after launch; route starts at
     +M s` and the recording starts at launch. Pull single frames, e.g. `ffmpeg -v error -ss <M-1> -i <run>/recording.mp4
     -frames:v 1 /tmp/lou-check.png` (plus one or two between N+2 and M), and look at them: roofs of the tall
     blocks must be uniform black, with no pale patches, no black/white speckle, no chunk-shaped holes.
  3. Check `bake_counters=` in `pzopt-bench.out`: a healthy 25 s route has strongMarks ≈ 14k and
     strongPastBudget ≈ 12k, fps ≈ 55 at the cap; a flooded one has 90k-350k marks and 20-26 fps.
  Any artifact or flooded counter: discard the run, re-run it, and say in the report which runs were thrown out.

## Releasing (GitHub + Steam Workshop), 2026-09-21

Order, all hands-off except the login: commit + push → `scripts/release.sh --publish --notes "..."`
(tag `b<version>-<yyyymmdd>-<hhmm>-<commit>`, zip + installers) → note the release in `docs/windows-test.md` (manifest
line count) → `scripts/workshop.sh --tag b<version>-<yyyymmdd>-<hhmm>-<commit>` (stages item 3805285544 under
`~/Zomboid/Workshop/PZ_Optimization/`, regenerates `workshop.txt`; copy it to `docs/workshop/workshop.txt`
and commit "workshop: stage the <commit> release") → upload → verify. The upload is one Steamworks API call
since 2026-09-24, no game and no OCR: `scripts/workshop.sh --tag <tag> --upload "<notes>"` stages and uploads in
seconds (`scripts/workshop-upload.py`: the game's `libsteam_api.so` + the running Steam client) → announce on Discord
(https://discord.gg/WNeQqYZ4T, every release, maintainer 2026-10-04): `workshop.sh --tag ... --upload` runs
`scripts/discord-announce.py --tag <tag>` after a successful upload (pass `--headline "<the change in a few words>"` by
hand for a better first line; a tag is posted once). The webhook URL is a secret and stays out of the public repo:
`~/.config/pzopt/discord-webhook`. Details and pitfalls: `.claude/skills/release-windows` ("Steam Workshop deploy").

- **The upload needs a really connected Steam client.** Before uploading run
  `tail -3 ~/.local/share/Steam/logs/connection_log.txt`: it must end in `[Logged On` with no
  `Session Replaced` after it. The client UI looks logged in and launches the game even when the same
  account logged in elsewhere (laptop) replaced its session; every upload then ends in EResult 2
  (the game's `failed to update workshop item, result=2`, three times on 2026-09-21) and Steam's
  `workshop_log.txt` says `Failed to initialize build on server (No Connection)`. Fix: `steam -shutdown`,
  start Steam again (cached login reconnects), re-check the log, upload.
- **Verify the upload**: `workshop-upload.py` prints Steam's own result (`upload OK: EResult 1`); `grep 3805285544
  ~/.local/share/Steam/logs/workshop_log.txt | tail -3` shows `Upload finished ... : OK`, and the
  public change-notes page `steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/changelog/3805285544` must list
  the new entry. The upload sends the animated `preview.gif` itself (the in-game uploader could only send
  `preview.png`). `steamcmd` has no cached login on this machine and is not needed; never type the maintainer's password.
- **No native libraries in a release** (maintainer's decision, 2026-09-22): `scripts/release.sh` defaults
  `PZOPT_DLSS=0`, so the zip carries no `natives/` (the DLSS shim would add NVIDIA's 58 MB library, Windows cannot
  use the .so, and `workshop.sh` refuses `*.so` because Steam bans the extension); `upscaler=dlss` without the shim
  runs as fsr1. Release from a detached worktree of the pushed commit (`git worktree add --detach /tmp/pzopt-release-<x>
  <sha>`) so peers' uncommitted files never block or leak into the zip; the page must stay ≤ 7,900 substituted
  characters (a "New!" section is ~150; retire the oldest card's heading or fold its image into a text section).

## Environment facts

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| OS | CachyOS (Arch), fish shell, `paru` for AUR, 16 cores, 30 GB, RTX 4090 |
| JDK | system `jdk-openjdk` 26; game bundles its own JRE (build.sh compiles with `--release` for it) |
| Game dir | `/games/steamapps/common/ProjectZomboid/projectzomboid/` (native Linux depot since 2026-09-18) |
| User dir | `~/Zomboid` (console.txt, Saves, Lua/, mods/, options.ini) |
| Layout detection | `scripts/pz-env.sh` (PZ_DIR / ZOMBOID env override) |
| Desktop | 5120x2160, 240 Hz; the game renders windowed at desktop resolution |
| Decompiler | CFR at `~/.local/share/java/cfr.jar` for reading; Vineflower for overrides |
| Code index | `.codegraph/` exists; use `codegraph_explore` before grep/Read. Since 2026-09-22 `codegraph.json` (`include: ["decompiled/"]`) indexes the game source too (3,402 of 3,407 classes: `build/`, `obj/` dirs are hard-ignored by codegraph, so `BuildLogic` and `zombie.erosion.obj.*` are not indexed; the three >1 MB `generation/*ScriptGenerator` are skipped). Rebuild after a re-decompile: `codegraph index` (~30 s, DB ~1.7 GB) |
| Java LSP | `jdtls` not installed (check `command -v jdtls` before relying on the LSP tool) |

## Reading game code

Read game classes from `decompiled/` (CFR output of all 3,407 game classes, package tree such as
`decompiled/zombie/iso/IsoChunk.java`). Never re-decompile or unzip the jar for those packages.
Only two methods lack bodies (`CompressIdenticalItems.areItemsIdentical`,
`ChooseGameInfo.readModInfoAux`); use `javap -c -p` for them. If the jar mtime changes (game
update) re-run `scripts/decompile.sh` and `scripts/regen-overrides.sh`.

## Layout

| Path | Purpose | Details |
|---|---|---|
| `src/` | overrides, shims and the `pzopt` helper package | `src/CLAUDE.md` |
| `scripts/` | build / install / decompile / test | `scripts/CLAUDE.md` |
| `harness/` | run.sh, analysis scripts, baselines, run outputs | `harness/CLAUDE.md` |
| `config/` | MangoHud profiles | `config/CLAUDE.md` |
| `docs/` | plans, findings, override edit log, dashboard | `docs/CLAUDE.md` |
| `tools/` | standalone Java probes (JFR dump, GLFW swap probe, static audit) | `tools/CLAUDE.md` |
| `tests/` | JVM-only unit tests for pzopt classes (`scripts/test.sh`) | |
| `decompiled/` | CFR output, local only | |
| `openspec/` | OpenSpec change proposals (opsx skills) | |

## Skills (in `.claude/skills/`)

| Skill | Use when |
|---|---|
| `run-queue` | scheduling any run (bench / drive / preset / mp / Workshop upload / showcase) on the desktop or a laptop, and every media encode / stitch (never beside a run), through `harness/queue.sh`; reading its result, reacting to machine events |
| `jev-walk` | Jev walks the player through a building on the collision-free game walk (`pzopt.Nav`, `explore=mirror director=jev`): test rooms (`mirror_corners`), captures, `navjudge.py` |
| `bench-run` | the run.sh arguments of a measurement run (bench / drive / parity / verify); launch them through `run-queue` |
| `showcase-drive` | recording the stock-vs-optimized drive videos and the quad stitch |
| `workshop-comparison` | the Workshop page's stock-vs-enhanced comparison animations (630x630 AVIF template, Features section): runs, stitch, window choice, publishing |
| `build-install` | compiling the overrides and installing them into the game dir |
| `release-windows` | building the Windows zip and publishing it as a GitHub release asset |
| `analyze-run` | reading a finished run: analyze, compare, waits, loadtime, dashboard |
| `override-game-class` | adding or changing an overridden game class |
| `game-update` | the jar changed: re-decompile, regen overrides, rebuild, re-baseline |
| `proton-run` | preparing a Windows/Proton comparison run |
| `mangohud-overlay` | HUD/CSV problems, launcher and display-server hooks |

## Current state (2026-09-19)

- Adopted Config defaults (max-zoom route mean 6.2 → 4.4 ms, p99 19.3 → 8.3):
  treesInChunkTexture, windowsInChunkTexture (off since 2026-10-01: baked glass hid the characters behind it, no
  measured gain; Translucent glass tiles stay per frame too, `glassTilesPerFrame`), bakeBudget=8 (never-baked
  levels only), lightingBudget=8 (queued, never drops JNI dirty bits), hotsaveIntervalSec=30,
  on top of wake + recalc pool. persistentVbo and translucentTilesInChunkTexture are ON by
  default since 2026-09-20 afternoon (maintainer's decision after confirming the fix): the
  chunk-sized black squares seen with them were `lightInfoChunkGate` leaving never-cached squares
  out of the bake (fixed; persistentVbo only changed the timing). The 2026-09-19 reports (black
  building lot, Translucent tiles baking black) were not reproduced on the bench route. Rig:
  `run.sh --shot-at N` + `harness/blacktiles.py`; 0 black tiles after the fix, uncapped 512 fps.
  Black one-tile rectangles beside walls were cutawayFast replaying the stock int-shifted
  occluder mask (fixed with an exact mask); JUMBO trees missing near buildings were the
  FBORenderTrees batch in chunk-texture mode (trees now bake via the plain sprite path).
- Verify runs on a copy of a real save: `--source-save Apocalypse/<name>` (template kept under
  Saves/<mode>/pzopt-template-<name>); auto-start presses click-to-start and marks started
  in every mode, so the run exits to desktop after `--quit-after`.
- Remaining tail with the PZDashboard mod is its 2 s collectors; measure with `--no-dashboard`.
- Uncapped: NVIDIA GL is GPU-bound (98 %) at 570 fps; Zink blocks ~1.8 ms/frame in swap.
  The in-game limiter is stock again; "Uncapped" is a real Display-options entry and a
  second "Menu framerate" combo caps the menus separately, the in-game pause menu included since 2026-09-23 (`pzopt.FrameCap`, Lua under
  `src/lua/`, setting in `~/Zomboid/pzopt/framecap.ini`). Uncapped runs: `--prop uncappedFps=true`.
  `uiRenderOffscreen=true` in options.ini removes the per-frame Lua UI draw. Both combos also
  offer 500/430/400/330/300 fps; the in-game choice is snapshotted before `Core.loadOptions`
  rewrites options.ini and a cap above 244 lives in framecap.ini (`gameFps=`); forced
  `uncappedFps=` runs restore the player's choice on the next boot (`restore=`).
- Since 2026-10-04 the three tabs below are one "PZ Optimization" tab (home page with presets, master switches and category
  tiles; sidebar; subcategory tabs; Simple / Advanced / Everything; Visuals as cards; Fix a problem; one search), organised by
  `src/lua/client/pzopt/pzopt_optimizations_layout.lua`; the groups Performance / Visuals / Tools are the old Optimizations /
  Enhancements / Profiler tabs. Harness: `options_nav=`, `options_shots=`, `options_joy=` (harness/CLAUDE.md).
- Options > Optimizations tab (2026-09-20): every Config key as a tick box / combo
  (`src/lua/client/pzopt/pzopt_optimizations_options.lua`, Java side `pzopt.UserOptions` +
  `PerformanceSettings` forwards), saved to `~/Zomboid/pzopt/options.ini`, applied on the next
  launch; `-Dpzopt.*` and the game dir's `pzopt.properties` (harness `--prop`) still win, so runs
  never depend on menu choices. Since 2026-09-25 upscaling, HDR output and ambient occlusion sit on their own
  Options > Enhancements tab (between Optimizations and Profiler), each with off / on preview clips (runs `enh-*`), and
  apply on Apply without a restart (`pzopt.Enhancements`: RenderScale / Dlss / Hdr / ChunkAo reconfigure through
  render-thread generation counters) except `hdr` / `hdrAuto` (on Linux they pick the window). Rig: `--flag live_set=`.
  "Export settings" / "Import settings..." on each of the three tabs (2026-10-01): the non-default settings of all three
  as `key=value` text to the clipboard and `~/Zomboid/pzopt/settings-export.ini`; the import sets the controls (unlisted
  keys back to the default, pinned ones untouched) and Apply saves them. Rig: `--flag options_io=1`.
  Profiler tab "Console log" (2026-10-01, a player debugging other mods): `consoleLog=all|warnings|errors|off` filters every
  `[pzopt]` console line (`pzopt.Log` + the Lua `PzoptLogInfo`), live; `run.sh` pins `consoleLog=all` (the harness reads info lines).
  Master switch `enabled` (2026-09-20 evening): `enabled=false` folds into `Overrides.enabled()`,
  i.e. the build-mismatch stock path everywhere; tab buttons "Disable all (stock game)" /
  "Enable all (recommended defaults)". `--prop enabled=false` is a stock run without a reinstall.
  The Enhancements and Profiler tabs have their own master switches (2026-09-28, live, default on): `enhancementsEnabled`
  / `profilerEnabled`; off, Config reads the tab's feature switches (`GATED`: upscaler, spriteFilter, hdr, hdrAuto, AO,
  sunShadows, reflections, darknessFloorPct, memoryTint, colorGrading, pixelLight, godRays, foliageSway / overlaySampling, overlay, overlayLog)
  as off, the saved choices stay; a -D / pzopt.properties pin wins, and harness runs measure regardless.
  Preview panel (2026-09-21 night): the whole page area right of the controls, fixed while the list scrolls, every
  element in a fixed slot (description slot = the longest description wrapped; the clips take the height left, spare
  height widens the bar rows) so nothing shifts between rows; for the setting under the mouse:
  the stock and the optimized clip of the same route side by side (off by default since 2026-09-26: "Before / after clips"
  tick box in each tab's header, key `previewClips`, saved at once; 28 GIFs: 8 route pairs at 512x216, 24 fps, 4 s, plus 6 overlay-off / overlay-on crop pairs for the overlay keys from runs `ov-off` / `ov-full`; Workshop-preview encode, under
  `src/media/ui/pzopt/compare/`, made by `harness/menu-gifs.py` from the show-*/bl-*/sbs-* recordings with the
  live fps burned in; decoded to textures by `pzopt.GifTextures`, at most two clips held, freed on close), the
  description, the value since boot / next launch, and effect bars per resource (`EFFECTS` in the Lua: game
  thread, render thread, other cores, GPU, VRAM, RAM, disk, load time, chunk arrival, -3..3, x axis labelled lowest / low / mid / high / ultra / max with mid = stock). Verified in game
  via a queue `cmd` job driving the menus with `ui-drive.py` (`/tmp/pzopt-menu-check.sh`); new
  `src/media/` ships through build.sh like the Lua. The paths are `media/ui/...` relative to the game dir:
  `ZomboidFileSystem`'s "work dir" is already `<game>/media`, strip the prefix before `getMediaFile`.
- Game thread (2026-09-20, `docs/archive/2026-09-24/results.md`): new heavy bench route `--flag route=S:450 --flag turn=90
  --route-seconds 25` (south through Rosewood, facing spinning). Adopted: weatherMaskIdleSkip,
  cutawayRadius=6, gridStackInterval=8, lightingRebakeMs=250, rebakeBudget=4/rebakeMaxFrames=3,
  lightSwitchCheckFrames=15, single-lookup Kahlua rawget, occluder masks on IsoChunk. 199 → 229 fps
  there, 230 → 238.5 on the 100 s route. No gain from bakeBudget=3, uiRenderOffscreen or
  lightingRebakeMs=1000. Game thread now 97 % busy with broad work (bakes 20 %, world update 23 %,
  Lua UI 10 %): 240 locked on that route needs a structural change, not more trims.
- In-game performance overlay (2026-09-20, `pzopt.Overlay`, F9 or `--prop overlay=true`; since 2026-09-21 its
  measurement is opt-in, `overlaySampling` tab tick box, default off, F9 shows a notice without it; since 2026-09-24 every Profiler-tab key applies at once, no restart (`Config.reloadLive`, `Overlay.reconfigure`); harness
  runs and `overlay=true` imply it — the Windows 0.5 s stutter was its JMX load sampling on the game thread): presented
  frame time, p99/p99.9/max/1%-low/jitter/spikes over 5 s, GPU busy (GL timer query), game/render
  thread load, verdict line, frame graph; every harness run also writes `pzopt-overlay.out`
  (MangoHud columns + epoch_ms) and `analyze.py` prints it as `overlay:`. Same numbers on
  Windows/Linux without MangoHud or RivaTuner. The stock "Display FPS" graph (K) is debug-only bars.
  Since 2026-09-21 night the overlay also says *what* the game thread does (`pzopt.GameThreadProfile`; every overlay element is a
  tab dropdown, off + its options: `overlayStats`, `overlayTree`, `overlayVerdict`, `overlayGraph`, `overlayFlame`, plus
  `gameThreadProfileHz`, 25 Hz since 2026-09-23): its stack sampled off-thread and folded into phases,
  sub-phases, hot methods and waits (a colour-coded tree in the overlay, biggest first, bars per row; the "game thread bound" verdict names the two biggest);
  `pzopt-gamethread.out` per run, `analyze.py` prints it as `game thread:`; the folded stacks go to `pzopt-stacks.out` and
  `harness/flamegraph.py <run>` renders the route as an SVG flame graph (the overlay draws the last 5 s live, `overlayFlame=right` by default;
  the frame graph has ms / frames axes). First reading on the uncapped spinning
  route (runs `gtprof-*`): 21 % of the game thread is the frame hand-off wait (`SpriteRenderer.pushFrameDown`, i.e.
  the GPU is the wall there), then chunk bakes 8 %, lighting JNI 7 %, player 6 %, zombies 4 %.
- Uncapped 400 fps pass (2026-09-20 evening, runs `u400-*`, in-game overlay log
  only, `--no-mangohud`): spinning route 273 → ~500 fps mean, p99 13.2 → 7.7 ms. Stock option
  `uiRenderOffscreen=true` is +40 % uncapped (runs pass `--option uiRenderOffscreen=true`). Adopted
  keys: cutawayInvalidateChanged, cutawayVisitPrefilter, lightInfoOncePerFrame, lightInfoChunkGate,
  occlusionSkipLightingOnly, soundZoneCache, chunkHandoffDivisor=8. Dead ends: weatherFxScalePct,
  lightingRebakeMs=1000, bakeBudget=4, hotsaveStaged (off: cross-file consistency). GPU is the wall
  from ~450 fps (`pzopt.GpuSections`, `--prop gpuSections=true`: chunk composite ~0.6 ms, bakes
  ~0.3-0.5 ms a frame). `harness/gametree.py` prints the game-thread call tree from a JFR run.
  Never build or decompile while a run is going; check `pzopt.sh status` says installed before a launch.
- JVM matrix on the desktop (2026-09-20 13:35, `docs/archive/2026-09-24/results.md`): GraalVM 25.0.3 is 7-9 % behind
  Zulu/C2 uncapped on the spinning route (copy kept at `jre64_graal`); Zulu + the tuned G1 JSON
  (`config/launcher/ProjectZomboid64.g1.json`, now installed) has the tightest tail (508 fps, p99 7.3 ms,
  game thread 81 %). The ~500 fps numbers need `persistentVbo=true translucentTilesInChunkTexture=true`
  (tab file or `--prop`); with both off the same route is 184 fps, so check the console `settings:` line.
- Thunderstorm pass (2026-09-20 evening, `docs/archive/2026-09-24/findings-scene-presets-2026-09-20.md` §3-5): the storm
  preset was 83 fps uncapped with nothing saturated. GameProfiler A/B (`--game-profiler`, `sections.py
  --thread game|render`, the file names are `MainThread` = game thread, `main` = render thread) and JFR
  showed puddles (4.5 ms/frame, stock re-packs every wet square) and the rain quads (73 % of the render
  thread, `VBORenderer` flushing every 28 quads). Adopted: `puddleCache` (`pzopt.PuddleCache`, packed
  puddle vertices per chunk level, lights/jiggle/depth patched per frame; `IsoPuddles` override, slot
  on `IsoChunk`) and `vboBatchKb=1024` + `vboFastQuads` (`VBORenderer` override). Storm route 83 → 131
  fps, p99 43 → 25 ms. Left: the rain particle path (~100k quads a frame at 5120x2160, walked twice on
  the game thread), splashes, `GameWindow.logic`. The 15:49 build with the VBORenderer change is on a
  peer session's suspect list for interior-object flicker; recordings `storm-rec-cur` vs
  `storm-rec-vbostock` are the A/B.
- Rain tiles + re-bake spread (2026-09-20 night, findings §5): `rainTiles` (`pzopt.RainTiles`,
  `ParticleRectangle` + `WeatherParticleDrawer` overrides: particle cell packed once, drawn once per
  screen cell) → desktop spinning storm 111 → 188 fps, laptop storm drive 84 → 106. The rain
  "vanishing" every 6 s in storms was five 50-90 ms stalls per lightning strike (all flash-dirtied
  chunk textures re-baked in one frame); lighting-only re-bakes now spread with
  `lightingRebakeBudget=8` / `lightingRebakeMaxFrames=30` (storm drive p99.9 57 → 12.5 ms, faint
  chunk checkerboard for ~90 ms while a flash ramps). Laptop runs go through
  `/tmp/pzopt-laptop-run.sh` on diego-flip (`~/PZ_Optimization-rain` worktree). The interior-object
  flicker itself was the peer's find, fixed in 100f441 (held re-bakes drew empty per-frame lists).
- Flicker fix (2026-09-20 evening, `docs/archive/2026-09-24/results.md`): objects inside buildings, doors, windows and
  corpses blinked out for 1-3 frames because stock `FBORenderLevels.invalidate()` empties the per-frame
  square lists and every pzopt held re-bake (`lightingRebakeMs`, `rebakeBudget`) drew the previous
  texture with them empty. FBORenderCell now keeps the lists across invalidations (IsoChunk clears them
  on pool reuse) and never holds cutaway re-bakes. Repro/metric: `run.sh --flag hold=10` + `harness/flicker.py`
  (runs `flick-*`); stock 3.8 vs broken 26 transient px/frame at `--scale 2560`.
- Carport roof flicker (2026-09-21, maintainer video: detached carport roof toggling every frame with the player
  on its SE edge and zombies around, steady while paused): the hide/show of an orphan structure (`emptyoutside`-only
  building) is now debounced, `roofHideDebounceFrames=8` (`FBORenderCutaways.checkOrphanStructures`, tab entry,
  counter `roof flips held`). No harness rig reproduced the per-frame toggle (teleport walk, edge `jitter=`, manual
  walk with `zombies=off` gave 0 flips; the maintainer's session with zombies gave 13 flips in 30 s), so the driver is
  still open; `--prop devCutawayLog=true` logs every decision. Spot: save copy `Apocalypse/2026-09-20_22-30-24`,
  `start=11024,6721`, roof 11021-11024 / 6718-6721. Issue #5: `treesInChunkTexture` clips JUMBO trees to their
  chunk-level texture (rectangle / flat top) at that spot.
- Issue #5 (2026-09-21, `docs/override-edits.md` tree pass entry): JUMBO trees baked through the plain sprite
  path were clipped to their chunk-level texture (up to 7 tiles wide, 16 tile heights tall vs a texture that
  covers the chunk plus two levels) and cut by upper-floor walls behind them (flat sprite depth vs the walls'
  height-tilted depth). `pzopt.TreeBake` + `FBORenderCell.pzoptBakeTrees` (`treeBakePass`, default on) draw
  baked trees last in every texture their sprite reaches, with a depth that rises with the crown; export
  fingerprints on `IsoChunk` re-bake neighbours holding a copy when a tree changes. Stock's own chunk-texture
  tree batch is broken (dark crown behind the house), so it stays unused. Repro / A-B: the issue's `--shot-at`
  command, `--prop treeBakePass=false` (old bake), `--prop treesInChunkTexture=false` (per frame). Found on the
  way: `vboFastQuads=true` draws per-frame FBORenderTrees quads ~40 % darker than the stock element path
  (runs `trees-town-off` vs `trees-town-off-slowvbo`), reported to the VBORenderer session, not fixed here.
- Fog pass (2026-09-21, `docs/archive/2026-09-24/findings-fog-2026-09-21.md`): heavy fog was 447 → 220 fps on the 120 km/h uncapped
  desktop route (stock draws ~190 screen-wide row rectangles per level, 12 per pixel, `gl_FragDepth`, one draw call
  each, plus a game-thread square walk that fed nothing). `fogPass` (default on): `pzopt.FogPass` + overrides of
  `ImprovedFog`, `ImprovedFogDrawer`, `MultiTextureFBO2` (the offscreen depth is a D24S8 texture now, read in place),
  hook in `FBORenderCell.renderFog`: one draw call into a `fogScalePct` (25) % fog buffer with a min-depth reduction
  and a depth-aware composite (thin wires stay intact), mipmapped noise sampling, per-chunk fog masks + segment cache
  on the game thread (`fogMaskFrames`, 20). Now 389 fps / 2.6 ms (clear 447 / 2.2), laptop 98 → 223 (clear 259).
  A/Bs: `--prop fogPass=false`, `fogScalePct=50|100`, `fogDepthCopy=true`, `devFogNoDraw`, `devFogFlat`; GPU
  sub-sections `fog.blit/rects/composite` with `gpuSections=true`. Screenshot rig: bench `--flag fog=heavy --shot-at 8`.
- Storm parity pass (2026-09-21 afternoon, `docs/archive/2026-09-24/findings-storm-parity-2026-09-21.md`, branch
  `worktree-lightning-zero-cost`): the 120 km/h storm drive on the desktop was GPU-bound at 232 fps / 4.3 ms vs
  ~450 clear; the puddle "GPU cost" was the render thread streaming every wet square through the ring buffer each
  frame. Adopted (all default on): `puddleVbo` (per-chunk-level GL buffers, uploads only on light / camera-chunk
  / rebuild changes, jiggle as a matrix translation), `puddleEarlyZ` (build.sh-generated `pzopt_puddles_*`
  shaders: depth from the vertex, drawn with GL_DEPTH_CLAMP), `rainSplashesFast` (geometric skipping instead of
  one game-RNG call per idle square per frame), `treeAppend` (a new chunk's trees drawn into the finished
  neighbour textures instead of re-baking them; half the neighbour re-bakes while driving). Storm with lightning
  232 → 390 fps (2.6 ms, p99 8.6), clear 420 → 454 fps; the flashes cost ~0.1 ms mean. Laptop numbers pending
  (it was shut down mid-pass). A reduced-resolution puddle layer and a two-texture flash blend were rejected.
- World-sound hitch (2026-09-22, `docs/archive/2026-09-24/findings-world-sound-2026-09-22.md`): `WorldSoundManager.addSound` walks
  `(radius/3)²` squares to scare fish and asks the cell for `(2·radius·hearing/8)²` chunks per call, and
  `Alarm.update` makes that call every frame while a house alarm rings: 0.4 ms per call at 600 (620 → 533 fps
  uncapped), 4.4 ms at 2000 (→ 170 fps). `worldSoundFast` (default on; `WorldSoundManager` + `FishSchoolManager`
  overrides: chunk walk clamped to the loaded grid, identical-call memo per game minute for walks of radius ≥ 8)
  → 0.007 ms. Rig: `--flag sound=R [sound_fixed=true sound_every=N sound_parts=true]`, `--prop devWorldSoundTiming=true`;
  the game itself adds ~12k tiny sounds/s on the bench route (0.7 % of the game thread), which is why the memo ignores small walks.
  `--preset helicopter` (flag `helicopter=true`) runs the stock chopper event over the route: its moving 500-radius sound is
  not a hitch (14–18 calls / 25 s, 0.3 ms stock → 0.08 ms with the exact fast fish walk, `FishNoiseWalkTest`).
- Louisville horde pass (2026-09-22 night, runs `lou-*`): the baseline had collapsed to 10.8 fps / GPU 97 % — the
  09-21 `LightDirt` strong re-bake path had no per-frame cap and turning marks ~every exterior level strong
  (`darkMulti` fade), a fps feedback loop near the scene's ~27 fps tipping point; `lightingStrongBudget=8` caps it,
  and the never-baked budget now counts creations alone and holds optional re-bakes while a creation was deferred
  (black squares beat stale light). Then the game thread (98 %, update 57 %): `animBonesParallel` (`pzopt.AnimBatch`,
  `AnimationPlayer` + `MovingObjectUpdateScheduler` overrides: the zombies' bone math on 8 worker threads after the
  postupdate loop, joined before rendering; `isBoneReparented` allocated a pooled lambda per bone per zombie, now a
  loop), `vehicleCull` (`IsoZombie.isVehicleBetween` bounding circle, 6 % → 0.7 %). Clean all-in run `lou-final2`:
  26.4 → 32.2 fps (p50 30 ms), GPU 46 %, batch flush 1 % of the game thread, zombie postupdate 19 → 14.5 %.
  Runs right after a peer's `update-*` / `release-updater` cmd job showed GPU 75-80 % with the game's own gpu_ms
  tripled (a leftover game / Steam UI client; a game at the main menu alone is ~40 % GPU here) — re-run those.
- Player LOS pass (2026-09-22 early morning, runs `lou-los*`): the player was 16 % of the game thread on the Louisville
  preset, 12 of it `IsoPlayer.updateLOS` walking the `lastSpotted` Stack once per spotted object per frame (it never
  empties in a horde: spotted × remembered compares). `playerLosFast` (new `IsoPlayer` override + `pzopt.PlayerLos`:
  identity set beside the stack, one addAll instead of 2.4k synchronized adds, per-frame `getSneakSpotMod` memo) and
  `zombieSpotFast` (`spottedNew` zero-chance early-out, look-vector trig skipped when already zero, `isVehicleBetween`
  over a per-frame list of the vehicles near the player) → player 3.7 %, +3 fps on the same tree. Dead ends, both
  recorded in `docs/override-edits.md`: a per-frame "not dirty" memo in `JNILighting` (sound, 0 misses, but the native
  says dirty for 99 % of the visible squares every frame — that is what the 8 % "lighting jni" is), and `getChunkDirty`
  outside `LightingJNI.update` (throws; zombies vanish). Builds go through `queue.sh submit cmd -- scripts/build.sh`
  when peers are running. The peer session's §3.1 losParallel plan is dropped (nothing left to parallelise).
- Camera zoom (2026-09-22, `docs/archive/2026-09-24/results.md` "Camera zoom changes", `docs/override-edits.md`): stock frees a chunk level's
  textures the frame it leaves the screen and bakes every level a zoom-out reveals in the frame it appears (the bake budget
  never caught them: DIRTY_CREATE is set after the deferral decision); a 0.25 → 2.5 wheel spin was an 80-375 ms frame, a
  notch at wide zoom 45-51 ms. `zoomRetain` (`pzopt.ZoomRetain`, default on): textures kept while the chunk is inside the
  widest zoom's screen rect, levels a zoom brings back or reveals baked under a per-frame plan (nearest first, count adapts to
  the last frame step, `zoomRebakeBudget` 12 / `zoomFrameMs` 10) with the kept texture on screen meanwhile; `zoomEaseMs` 300 /
  `zoomEase` (`pzopt.ZoomEase`, CSS-style cubic Bézier, default "ease"): the zoom motion is time-based instead of 0.03 per frame
  and a snap. Jumps 375 → 25 ms worst frame, notches and eased spins inside the route's own noise. Rig: `--flag zoom=0.25
  zoom_cycle=S [zoom_span=9] [zoom_jump=true]`, `harness/zoomsteps.py`, `attribute.py`/`sections.py --after-mark zoom-:1`.
  Other sessions' forced `uncappedFps=` runs leave `framecap.ini restore=` that the next boot applies: pass `--prop uncappedFps=true`
  for a deterministic cap in an optimized run; stock runs need `--option frameRate=240 --option uncappedFPS=false`.
- Zombie simulation on all cores (2026-09-22 04:00-06:30, `docs/plan-zombie-multithread.md` §6, runs `lou-zm-*`,
  `spin-zm-*`): the zombie side of the game thread now runs through `pzopt.FrameBatch` (`frameThreads`, 8 workers +
  the game thread, one batch at a time). Keys, all default on: `ecsLookupFast` (the component lookup behind every
  `getStateMachine` / `getActionContext` / `getVariable` memoised; `ECSComponent` + `ECSEntity` overrides, cached
  field on `IsoZombie`), `actionConditionFast` (bool / int rule operands read typed, `CharacterVariableCondition`
  override), `actionEvalParallel` (each zombie's action-state transitions evaluated on the workers between the
  postupdate loop and the animator: `IsoGameCharacter` override splits `postUpdateAnimating` at
  `pzoptPostUpdateAnimatingRest`, `ActionContext` override evaluates / applies; the game thread first snapshots every
  callback variable not in `ActionEval.PURE_CALLBACKS` — `blunge` runs a pathfind line test through a plain
  ArrayDeque pool, `bHasTarget` / `bthump` / `beatbodytarget` have side effects — rig `devActionEvalCheck`: 860k
  contexts, 0 mismatches), `skinTransformsPrecompute` + `skinPalettePrecompute` + `shadowPrep` + `boneIndexCache`
  (the bone worker also fills the skin sets, the shader palette and the shadow ellipse; `AnimatedModel` override,
  `pzopt.ShadowPrep`), `lightingReadParallel` (the pre-pass lighting drain reads its chunk levels one per worker —
  libLighting64's getters are pure reads, the room / meta hooks are deferred to the game thread;
  `pzopt.LightingBatch`, rig `devLightingReadCheck`: 425k squares, 0 mismatches), `zombieCullSortFast` (`IsoWorld`
  override, `pzopt.SortKeys`), `lightingStrongFrameMs` (A/B key, default 0: halving the strong re-bake
  budget after a slow frame only held stale light on a steadily slow scene; the "GPU-doubled" Louisville regime of
  ~30 % of the day's runs was `see_all=true` marking the whole grid every pass — a preset artefact, ~2/3 of recorded
  runs tip into it; its deferral flood was the zoom session's stale pending bits, `build-zoom-leak-fix`).
  Same build (06:00), keys off → on: Louisville 46.4 → 57.5 fps (lou-zm-final-off4 vs cd4-on; p50 21.6 → 15.8 ms;
  32.2 at lou-final2 in the morning),
  Rosewood spin uncapped 336 → 472 fps (p99 11.5 → 7.3 ms). §3.1 losParallel dropped (the player session's
  `playerLosFast` took `updateLOS` 16 → 3.7 %); the per-frame simulation checksum (`devSimChecksum`, `pzopt-sim.out`,
  `harness/simdiff.py`) cannot compare two runs (never frame-aligned) — per-phase in-run dual evaluation is the rig.
  Pitfalls: an override the JVM touches before the logger (IsoWorld) must use `Overrides.onClassLoadedQuiet`
  (the loud marker killed every launch for 25 minutes); Vineflower's `IsoWorld.init` needs 7 typing fixes;
  `GameThreadProfile` is safepoint-biased (hot-method self time lands on loop back-edges). The harness summary now
  carries `zombie_batches=` and `bake_counters=` (`pzopt-bench.out`) so short runs still report the batch and
  bake / re-bake counters.
- Characters draw pass (2026-09-22 morning, `docs/archive/2026-09-24/findings-characters-draw-2026-09-22.md`, runs `cd*-*`): the game-thread
  render sub-phase `characters draw` (renderMovingObjects) on the Louisville horde 13.2 % → 4.4-4.8 % (~3.0 → ~0.75 ms a
  frame; 11.3 % with the keys off on the same tree). Stock already ran `ModelSlotRenderData.init` on its eight-thread
  executor (`Threading.ModelSlotInit`); the game-thread cost was `initModel`, one submit per zombie, the culled zombies'
  shadow ellipse and the HashSet walk. `charDrawPrep` (`pzopt.CharDraw`): the object walk on a worker from the top of the
  cell render; before the chunk bakes the game thread does the visibility test, `checkUpdateModelTextures` and the lazy
  per-square lighting refresh (the only part that must stay on the game thread: `JNILighting.update` behind
  `lighting[p].lightInfo()`), then `updateLights` + `initModel` + `init` + the camera record run per zombie on the pass's
  own pool (`charDrawThreads`); the stock loop runs over the on-screen list, `TextureDraw.drawModel` takes the prepared
  data. `zombieAtlasFast`: `IsoZombie.pzoptRenderFlat`, a flat copy of the render chain for the ~1,100 atlas zombies and
  the prepared model zombies. Overrides: TextureDraw, ModelInstance (thread-local light scratch, frame stamp). Analysis:
  `harness/subtree.py <run> [--frame pzopt.CharDraw.start]` (analyze.py rounds the sub-phase to whole percents). The
  preset is bistable (`see_all=true`, the parity session's finding): a run with settle-phase gpu_ms ~13 / bakes ~30k per
  period is in the GPU-bound re-bake regime and not comparable. A startup death with a 0-byte console that day was an
  override marker calling `onClassLoaded` from a class the logger touches first (use `onClassLoadedQuiet`); diagnose with
  `--env JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-Xlog:exceptions=info:file=/tmp/x.log`.
- Upscaler second pass (2026-09-23, branch `upscaler-fix`, `docs/plan-upscalers.md`): the FSR "second view cone"
  (`VisibilityPolygon2` blur `displaySize` unscaled) and the aiming cursor's background (`IsoCursor`) fixed. DLSS on the
  4090 at 5120x2160: the network costs 0.64 ms (E) / 1.54 ms (K) at full output, so it only beats no upscaler when it
  writes less than the screen: new defaults `dlssPreset=e dlssOutputPct=67 dlssOutputFilter=rcas dlssDirectColor=true`
  (+22 % in the static storm + stock-fog scene, image sharper than full-size K); the drive stays DLSS-negative. The
  120 km/h drive harness no longer swings into the roadside (check `harness: drive t=` telemetry before trusting a drive).
- Variable refresh (2026-09-24, `docs/archive/2026-09-24/findings-vrr-2026-09-24.md`): stock borderless never got VRR (KWin / Mutter /
  gamescope need a fullscreen window); `borderlessFullscreen` (Linux default) makes it a GLFW monitor window at the desktop
  mode. `pzopt.Vrr` reads DRM `VRR_ENABLED`; while on, `vrrCap` (157 at 165 Hz) and `presentPacing=auto` (gpu: swap held to
  GPU-completion lag, judder 3.10 -> 0.95 ms). Mac `macPresent` (Metal bridge, ProMotion 4.17 ms steps, off by default,
  `devMacPresentCheck` rig). Rigs: `harness/pacing.py`, `presentprobe.c`, `vrrprobe.py` (every run.sh run writes
  `present.txt` / `vrr.txt`). The desktop's KWin VRR policy is Never by the maintainer's choice: set Automatic only inside
  the test job. Native-Wayland optimized runs segfault at exit (not VRR code, open).
- Sound engine pass (2026-09-24, `docs/findings-sound-2026-09-24.md`): rig `pzopt.SoundProbe` (`house_alarm`, `car_alarm`,
  `gunshots`, census `pzopt-sound.out`), bench `sound-storm-horde`, `run.sh --record-audio game` (the game's own PipeWire
  stream), `harness/soundprof.py` / `audio.py` / `audio-judge.py` (Jev: cutoffs, gaps, dropouts, clicks, clipping; in every
  queue result of a `--record-audio game` run). The game mixes 5.1 at 32 kHz on every device (hardcoded in
  `libfmodintegration64`), so on stereo output the OS downmix clipped under gunfire (6,000-19,000 samples in 25 s, stock);
  `audioLimiter` (FMOD's limiter at the master's head, stereo fold ahead of it on stereo devices, -2 dBFS) -> 0. Sound
  code on the game thread 5.3 -> 2.7 % in the horde (`emitterIdleSkip`, `soundTickHz` 60); FMOD's threads 0.1 core. The
  harness fades the mix out before quitting in sound runs (`exit_fade_ms`; the quit stops every sound at once).
- Ambient occlusion (2026-09-24, `docs/findings-ambient-occlusion-2026-09-24.md`, off by default, tab section "Ambient
  occlusion"): `pzopt.ChunkAo` bakes ground-truth-style horizon AO with 32-sector visibility bitmasks into the chunk
  textures at bake time (the FBO depth is an exact ortho view space: 424.27 squares per unit of depth), context from the
  eight neighbour textures, lighting-only re-bakes multiply the kept R8 AO, computes budgeted in-bake / deferred (ratio
  blend 2·src·dst). Cost on the desktop: 0 standing, ~4 us/frame walking, ~1.3 % of GPU time in the worst streaming
  (storm route, 120 km/h drive at max zoom). The per-frame screen mode (`aoMode=screen`) cost 90-140 us/frame: fixed
  per-pass cost dominates on NVIDIA (~8 us for an empty pass, `glGenerateMipmap` of a 1024 chunk texture ~65 us).
  macOS (GL 2.1 context) rejects GLSL 1.40: AO switches itself off there. Rigs: `devAoView=1`, `devAoTiming`, `devAoDumpFrame`.
- Reflections (2026-09-26, `docs/findings-reflections-2026-09-25.md`, off by default, tab section "Reflections", applies
  at the next launch): `pzopt.Ssr`, pixel-projected. The iso mirror is a 1D problem (a surface h levels up mirrors 2h
  below itself in its column), so the chunk composite scatters each fragment into its mirror pixel (imageAtomicMax keys,
  two alternating R32UI hashes, per-square water / puddle map, per-texture gating) and the water / puddle shaders read one
  key. Characters: a box pass after the water, for the next frame. Desktop: 0 us without water, +11..15 us at a river
  (the stock water pass alone is 1.4 ms), +27..30 us in rain with puddles. Never `glGet` per draw on the render thread
  (NVIDIA's threaded driver syncs). Follow-up list: `docs/plan-reflections-followup.md`. Rigs: `harness/ssr/`,
  `devSsrAlternate`, `devSsrTiming`, `devSsrView=1`, `devSsrDumpAt`.
- Town drive pass (2026-09-24/25, `docs/findings-town-drive-2026-09-24.md`): Rosewood 120 km/h drive at the 240 cap,
  stock 153 fps / p99 36 ms -> 235 fps / p99 8.2 ms / 1 %-low 122. On by default: `bakeScheduler` + `bakeBudgetAdaptive`
  (one prioritized per-frame bake budget, `pzopt.BakeScheduler`), `occlusionGrantedOnly`, `bakeMipLevels=3`,
  `renderChunkTopUp=32`, `persistentVboFrameSync` + `persistentVboSlots=4`, `fliesToggleFix` (new `FliesSound` override),
  and `presentPacing=auto` now paces at a fixed refresh too (maintainer's choice: +1.7 ms step-to-screen on average for
  frames off their slot 28 -> 11 %). Measured and off: `bakeSmooth`, `glNoSync` (`TextureID` / `TextureFBO` /
  `DeadBodyAtlas` overrides), `bakeDeadlinePct`, `uniformCache`, `compositeShaderRun`, `seamSpread`, `occlusionRetain`.
  Not locked at 240: game-thread bursts (tile rendering + bake preparation, chunk arrivals, lighting). Rigs:
  `harness/frame-causes.py`, `holes.py` (black holes in the picture; a fake 239 fps run baked nothing), `jfr-windows.java`.
  Queue runs of a worktree build need `--install opt`.
- Texture compression (2026-09-25, `docs/findings-texcompress-2026-09-25.md`): with `textureCompression=true` (low-end
  preset, stock Steam Deck defaults) Mesa compressed DXT5 on the CPU inside `glTexImage2D` on the render thread (41 ns/px,
  ~26 s a boot): the flip's menu 25-34 fps for 10-16 s after boot. `texCompress=auto` (default): workers stage the raw
  level 0 in a persistent 128 MB buffer, the GPU builds ImageData's mip chain (bit-exact) and encodes BC3
  (`pzopt.TexBcGpu`, fitted to the GPU's measured decode palette, `pzopt.TexBcPalette`); render thread ~0.1 s a boot, menu
  60 fps from 4 s, quality above both drivers. `worker` = CPU encode (`pzopt.TexBc`, the macOS GL 4.1 path, untested on
  the Mac); `texCompressCache` (off, ~230 MB). Rigs: `tools/TexCompProbe.java` (+ `harness/texprobe/wrap.sh` via
  `run.sh --wrap`), `harness/texdiff.py`, `harness/pad/menu-idle.txt`, `devTexCompTiming`.
- Soft sun / contact shadows (2026-09-25, `docs/findings-contact-shadows-2026-09-25.md`, off by default, Enhancements tab
  "Sun shadows"): the static world's sun shadows baked by the chunk AO kernel (visibility bitmask over the sun disk, march
  length from the sun height, outdoor squares only, a sun step recomputes a texture a frame); characters, atlas zombies and
  cars as capsules in one instanced pass after the composite (`pzopt.CapsuleShadow`, Quilez capsule shadows on the scene
  depth), also against torches / headlights at night; characters dimmed in static shade (`SunShadow.characterFactor`).
  Desktop: capped drive tails at parity (+33 us GPU streaming), crowds +10-15 us; the flip's character pass ~125-200 us
  (open). Rigs: `harness/contact/kernel_rig.py` (offline kernel on EGL), `alt.py` + `devSunAlternate`, flag `crowd=N`.
- Stairs wall flicker (2026-09-25, `docs/findings-wall-flicker-2026-09-25.md`): with every lighting key on the walls blinked
  while walking between floors (flip). Cause: pixelLight's torch facing normal came from screen derivatives of a pixel-centre
  position with a nearest DEPTH16 texel's depth, which flipped with the camera's sub-pixel offset. `pplTexelPos` (normal from
  the chunk-depth texel and its neighbours 2 texels away, only where a light reaches; +52 us/frame on the flip) and
  `bakeLevelChangeFrames` / `bakeLevelChangeRadius` (a floor change bakes the 3x3 chunks round the player at once) -> blink =
  stock. Rig: `--flag explore=stairs --flag director=jev` + `harness/stairs-flicker.py` (harness/CLAUDE.md).
- Light leaks (2026-09-26, `docs/findings-ppl-leaks-2026-09-26.md`): with pixelLight a room behind a wall lit up on the
  basement stairs and walls took colours from another floor. `pplTorchCanSee` (the torch off squares the player cannot see:
  the native lists it behind walls without adding it), `pplOwnLevelLights` (dynamic lights on their own level only, not ±1),
  `pplShadowDepthTest` (the reprojected torch shadow mask ignores texels of another surface after a floor change). Compare
  against `pixelLight=false` with devCapture crops of the stairs walk (`--flag time_of_day=1 --flag lights=on --flag torch=on`).
- Driving smoothness (2026-09-26, `docs/findings-car-jitter-2026-09-26.md`): the car's "micro rubber band" was the
  driving camera placed inside the player's update, before the car moved (per session / per town stretch: object update
  order), plus 100 Hz Bullet steps drawn without interpolation. `vehicleSmooth=interp` (pzopt.VehicleSmooth: the frame
  draws vehicles, seated characters and the re-centred camera between the last two physics steps, simulation untouched;
  WorldSimulation override), `driveLookSmooth` and `cameraScreenPixels` (pzopt.DriveCamera, PlayerCamera override), all
  default on. Flip, 120 Hz: world judder median 5.1 -> 0.7 px, car 5.4 -> 1.0 px in town; zoom 0.5 10.5 -> 0.9 px.
  Measured and left off: extrap, physicsStepHz, physicsStepMode, frameClockSmooth, vsyncLock. Rig `--prop
  devDriveJitter=true` + `harness/drivejitter.py <run> --present` (real display times from pzopt-driveswap.out +
  present.txt). What remains is late frames in town (game-thread bursts at chunk arrival): `docs/plan-drive-game-thread.md`.
- Darkness floor, remembered places, colour grading (2026-09-26, released `ea05422` + Workshop card 37,
  `docs/findings-darkness-grading-2026-09-26.md`, candidate B of the graphics plan; off by default, Enhancements tab section
  "Darkness, remembered places and colour grading", applies at once): `darknessFloorPct` (pzopt.Darkness: seen squares above
  ground keep a soft minimum light, applied to the native's per-square light in LightingJNI, no frame cost; unseen stays
  black), `memoryTint` (out of sight drawn grey / dim / cool by the vision-cone pass itself, remembered rooms keep their
  furniture; no dearer than the stock pass), `colorGrading` (pzopt.Grade / GradeMath: looks per hour and weather incl. the
  Purkinje night shift, baked on a worker into a 65³ LUT fused with the stock `screen.frag` tail, which skips its 3D-noise
  grain: screen pass 100 -> 72 us at 5K; `.cube` overlays in `Zomboid/pzopt/luts/`). Rigs: `devDarkAlternate=N` + `gpuSections`
  (same-run on / off GPU sections), `devDarkStats`, `devGradeAblate`, harness `options_select=<key>`; published media come from
  in-game `devCapture` (the desktop recorder showed a browser window over the game), `harness/stitch-darkness.py`,
  `darkness-card-gif.py`, `menu-gifs.py` kind `pane`. Cost runs need their own `-Dpzopt.userOptionsFile` (the desktop's
  tab file turns on HDR, DLSS and AO).
- Sprite filtering (2026-09-26, candidate A, `docs/findings-sprite-filter-2026-09-26.md`, off by default, Enhancements tab
  "Sprite filtering", live): `spriteFilter=sharp` (`pzopt.SpriteFilter`): texel-aware anti-aliased point sampling zoomed in at
  non-integer scales (0.75), stock point sampling at whole multiples and 1:1, zoomed out one explicit mip level
  `floor(log2(texels a pixel))` with two adaptive diagonal taps (`spriteFilterMin=rgssa2`) + an empty-area probe, the bake mip
  chain trimmed to 2 levels; per-frame tile variants; per-zoom program variants swapped in by re-pointing the game's own
  StartShader (TextureDraw), compiled after a swap on settings change. Result: +15 % (0.75) to +30 % (1.5) detail on a held frame,
  +25 % in motion at 2.5 with stock's shimmer per detail; composite GPU at or under stock (0.75 +0.4 us, drive -0.3 us, spin
  1.75 / 2.5 -59 / -147 us); drive tails = stock. Dropped: Golus's RGSS as published (+203 us), level-0 taps past 2x (seams +
  bandwidth), Lanczos level 1 (+96 us composite on NVIDIA). Rigs: `devSpriteFilterCycle` / `ShotModes` / `ShotAb`,
  `harness/spritefilter/`.
- The real sky (2026-09-26, `docs/findings-sky-2026-09-26.md`, with `sunShadows`, off by default): `pzopt.Sky` puts the sun
  and the moon where they stand for the game's date and hour (season latitude / high noon; `skyPath=arc` is the old path);
  the key light is the moon at night (`moonShadows`, phase and height); cloud shadows (`cloudShadows`, `pzopt.CloudShadow`:
  a drifting Perlin-Worley field, the chunk composite reads each texture's kept direct-sun share through bindless handles,
  water patched too) cost 0 us median at 5K; a low sun's long shadows come from a far-field column-height march
  (`sunShadowFar`, `sunMinElevationDeg` 2); wall faces come from a grid wall mask (walls under eaves were taken for roofs).
  Rigs: `devCloudTiming` + `devCloudAlternate`, `devCloudView`, `devSunView` 4-7, `devSkyDate`, `devCloudCover`.
- Spiffo's roof flicker (2026-09-27, `docs/findings-spiffo-roof-flicker-2026-09-27.md`): with DLSS + pixelLight a flat roof over
  a lit room flipped between its light and the room's every frame (the level pick moved with the jitter). `pplTexelHeight`
  (height from the texel the pixel shows) + `pplFloorSnap` (flat texels within two DEPTH16 steps of a level are on it); dev
  views `devPplView=14|15` (with `colorGrading=false hdr=false`).
- Zoom light flicker (2026-09-30, `docs/findings-zoom-light-flicker-2026-09-30.md`): after the relief update the lamp pools
  blinked while zooming at night with HDR on. `HdrLight`'s window -> light-map projection was float differences of a ~10^6 px
  camera offset (+-50 % error, new every frame the offset moved); now double, and re-projected on frames without a new map.
  Rig: zoom cycle + 1:1 `devCapture` crop + `harness/zoom-flicker.py` (Jev); 35,318 -> 678 blinking blocks (Jev fixed 0.89).
- Build 42.21 (2026-09-28, revision `4a0e9546ec`, stable branch; `docs/override-edits.md` "Port to Build 42.21"): the
  overrides were three-way merged (Vineflower of the 42.20.4 jar kept in `pzsrv-stock/` as base, ours, 42.21); 40 of the
  113 classes changed. 42.21 made `saveCellAsync` moot (stock queues and throttles cell saves) and fades trees while
  driving (`pzopt.XxlTreeFade` keeps baked XXL trees in step, 12-square radius). `decompiled/` is the 42.21 CFR tree; the
  42.20 one is in `build/port4221/decompiled-42.20/`. The bench save still logs "invalid room metaID" on 42.21, stock too.
- 42.21 drive regression (2026-10-03, `docs/findings-4221-drive-regression-2026-10-03.md`): the optimized 120 km/h drive fell
  500 -> 305 fps with the port because 42.21 counts driving as aiming for the tree cutaway (every tree in the 2048 px cutaway
  square turns see-through); with baked trees each one re-baked its chunk and the neighbours holding its copy up to four
  times and drew per frame. `treeRebakeLazy` (re-bake only on leaving / rejoining the bake, rejoining at the next check),
  `treeCutawayReach` (a see-through tree stays baked unless its sprite box nears the mask's marked ellipse, 21 % of the
  square; its fade stepped as IsoTree.render would; GPU proof `devReachCheck`): daily drive 320 -> 430
  fps, p99 9.3 -> 6.4 ms; `driveTreeCutaway` (42.21's rule) is OFF by default (maintainer, 2026-10-03): 507-514 = the 42.20 level, nothing else in
  42.21 slows it. be50962's `treeCutawayScissor` hid the cutaway at zoom != 1 (its box was in offscreen px, the world
  framebuffer is screen-sized); removed in the hotfix, the cutaway (stock's works, the "~2 % of frames" reading was a probe
  error) costs ~2 % on the default drive, inside the run spread. `edgeTestFast` (`pzopt.EdgeFast`):
  42.21's lambda-based `IsoGridSquare.isBlockedTo` written out for our separation callers (23.9 M calls, 0 different;
  154 vs 181 ns a call, a marginal gain).
- Mod compatibility (2026-10-01, `docs/findings-mod-compat-2026-10-01.md`, branch `mod-compat`): `pzopt.ModCompat` scans the
  launch's Java mods (`-javaagent` jars, ZombieBuddy `javaJarFile`) at Config init and switches off the boolean keys of every
  edited method a mod patches (`modCompat=auto`, map from `scripts/override-methods.py`, tested mods in `ModCompat.KNOWN`);
  `pzopt.LuaOrigin` tells a mod's Lua function from the game's (`uiLuaFast` vanilla-slot fix, mod-drawn UI at the stock
  rate unless `uiRetainedMods`); `luaWorkerGate` runs a frame worker's Java -> Lua call on the game thread (new LuaCaller
  override). Matrix: `run.sh --mod` copies Workshop mods for direct launches, `harness/compat/make-fixture.sh`. ZombieBuddy
  2.3.3 loads no Java mod on 42.21, stock install too.
- macOS on OpenGL 4.1 core (2026-10-01, `docs/findings-mac-gl41-2026-10-01.md`, branch `mac-gl41`): `macGlCore` (default on)
  asks GLFW for 4.1 core instead of Apple's legacy 2.1 and `pzopt.CoreGl` rebuilds LWJGL's function table with Java upcalls
  for the removed fixed-function calls (alpha test as an injected fragment uniform, matrix stacks, immediate mode, push /
  pop attrib as snapshots), aliases, no-ops for absent entry points (LWJGL's `OpenGL33` is then true: the game runs its 3.3
  path as on Linux); `pzopt.CoreGlsl` translates every shader. Every Enhancement now runs on the Mac (gates are
  `CoreGl.legacyMac()`): god rays through a new fragment volume path (no compute), SSR in march mode (no image atomics), HDR
  alpha-gain with its world passes. Cost at parity with 2.1 (spin 106 vs 107 fps) only with `macGlTimerQueries=false` (the
  default): Apple's GL timer queries cost a third of the frame rate. Mac cost runs need an empty
  `-Dpzopt.userOptionsFile` (the Mac's tab file has the Enhancements on). `run-mac.sh install` now ships pzopt's shader files.
- Car glass (2026-10-01/02, `docs/findings-car-glass-2026-10-01.md`, worktree `~/pzopt-wt/carglass` branch `car-glass`, off by default,
  Enhancements tab "Car glass", next launch): car windows become glass (Fresnel, the game's sky texture in the world frame, per-car
  octahedral reflection probes marched through the scene depth before the vehicles, GGX sun / moon / lamp glints, an analytic cabin
  with seats and occupants behind the glass, raindrops, stock cracks / blood kept; side mirrors silvered and glass painted outside the window zones, e.g. the CarLuxury coupe's rear
  quarter windows, found per skin from the diffuse). The game's vehicle programs stay stock: a separate
  glass program (build.sh's `pzopt_glass_*` copies) redraws only the window triangles. Trap: glass code inlined into the stock vehicle
  shader made every car fragment ~4x slower (registers). Drive cost ~+15 us GPU. Rig `car_rig=N`; in-run variant cycles
  `devCarGlassAlternate` + `devCarGlassCycle`; `scripts/test.sh` links the glass programs headless (`/tmp/glslcheck`).
- The people inside a car (2026-10-03, `docs/findings-car-occupant-2026-10-03.md`, worktree `~/pzopt-wt/occupant` branch
  `car-occupant`, with car glass, `carOccupant=impostor` default, next launch): stock never draws a seated character; each occupant
  is drawn by the game's own character path into an offscreen impostor tile before the cars (world projection zoomed onto the cabin,
  the seat in the glass's chassis frame G) and the glass maps its chassis points into the tile (cutaway over the seats by default,
  `carOccupantOcclusion` for the physical result). Tiles are reused: redrawn when a bone moves (≤ 60 Hz), at least 4 Hz, at once on a
  6° turn / zoom / seat change; between, the glass reprojects through the old tile's G → NDC rows. Cost parked +1.3 us GPU, driving
  ~+2-5 us (every-frame drawing was +22-33 us). Traps: stock's inVehicle seat transform puts the model at the rear of the car; the sun
  shadow pass draws cars from the sun (glass now only for `VehicleModelCamera`); `Transform.getRotation` is unnormalised;
  a pass that binds its own framebuffer mid-world must put back `TextureFBO.lastID`, not `ShadowAtlas.worldFbo()` (stale: the car
  blinked out each refresh) and not a glGet (~0.7 ms). Rigs
  `car_rig_seat=true [car_rig_spin=D] [car_rig_p2=split|npc car_rig_p2_car=same|other car_rig_p2_count=N]`, dev views 12-18,
  `devCarOccupantDump`, `harness/carglass/occframes.py` / `occcost.py`. Several people / cars / split screen work (tiles per car and
  view, 4 cars a view, the rest the proxy): split screen driver + passenger 1.2 us, six occupied cars 1.6 us.
- Mirrors and windows (2026-10-03, `docs/findings-mirrors-2026-10-03.md`, `pzopt.Mirrors`, key `mirrors`, off by default,
  Enhancements tab "Mirrors and windows", next launch): wall mirrors (`IsMirror` tiles, now drawn per frame) and window panes
  reflect the scene in front. The ortho camera makes the reflected ray of a vertical pane a straight screen line (N-wall pane
  down-left, W-wall down-right, iso depth -2/3 a square), reaching the floor after 3 h squares. Static part: marched after the
  chunk composite into a per-pane atlas tile (pan-invariant; refreshed when new / more on screen / every 30 frames, the pass at
  most every 4th frame); characters / vehicles drawn once more through the plane's reflection (MV post-multiplied by B^-1 R B,
  `glFrontFace(GL_CW)`) into a layer; one composite per frame, hardware depth test at the pane's analytic depth; panes the
  composite drew no pixel of (visibility feedback through a persistent buffer, no sync) are skipped. GL 4.3 path (image stores)
  and a GL 4.1 path (macOS: static pass into an atlas framebuffer in tile space). Cost GPU-bound at 5K: +13 us GPU / +34 us frame
  (29 windows), crowd +25 / +37; Mac within noise. Traps: an atomic per pixel on one counter serialised the composite
  (73 us); mapped-coherent host memory as the shader's target grew it to 300 us walking; PBO + fence readback cost 137 us of
  render thread (NVIDIA threaded driver); `glGet` every 120 frames was ~4.7 us a call on average. Rigs `find=mirror|window`
  (`find_at`, `find_dist`, runs after `place_tile`), `devMirrorsCycle` / `devMirrorsView` / `devMirrorsLog`,
  `harness/mirrors/` (cost.py, crops.py, march_sim.py, masks.py). Since 2026-10-04 (`mirrorsGeometry`, `pzopt.MirrorGeometry`)
  a wall mirror's room is rebuilt behind the glass from the game's tiles (furniture as the sprite of its turned facing, flipped;
  the far wall in the mirror wall's paint; depth-map distances), taken where the march saw nothing or a stand-in: the
  medicine cabinet's guessed glass 0.36 -> 0.005. Since 2026-10-08 (`docs/findings-mirror-rooms-2026-10-08.md`) a mirror mirrors only people in its own room, a pane the player never saw shows the stock glass, the room geometry is lit from each square's own light (never-seen squares left out), and a pane in a room is re-marched when its room changed instead of every 30 frames (the stand-ins jumped while walking): `harness/mirrors/room-judge.py`, scene `mirror_corners=pair`.
- Cut-open upper floor (2026-10-05, flip save `Sandbox/2026-09-26_03-37-09`, `docs/override-edits.md` last entry): near the player
  stock stops drawing a building's orphan structures (upper-floor squares with exterior wall / ceiling / roof but no room), so
  the rooms show open. `pplCutEdge`: furniture flush against such a hidden square's edge (a bathtub) took its dark outdoor light
  in pixelLight; now the room's (`FBORenderCutaways.pzoptSquareHidden`). `aoRoofSkip`: no AO on roof tiles (their depth is a
  staircase: the risers' AO, spread by `aoEdgeShade`, drew dark bands across roofs); dev `devAoRoofView`.
- Louisville 120 plan A (2026-10-06, `docs/findings-louisville-120-tile-record-2026-10-06.md`, `tileRecordParallel`, off by
  default): the per-frame translucent tile pass recorded per chunk level on the frame workers (`pzopt.DrawRecorder` /
  `TileRecord` / `RenderScratch`; new overrides SpriteRendererStates, IOpenGLState, IndieGL, IsoObject, IsoSprite,
  IsoGridSquare), asynchronously while the game thread draws the rest, spliced in stock order; exact by `devDrawListCheck`
  (0 / 253k entries). Pass 0.80 -> 0.33 ms a frame; the lock's miss frames are logic bursts, so whole-run misses moved
  11.3 -> 11.0 %. Trap: a tile's IsoSpriteInstance is its sprite's shared def (renderprep writes it).
- Uninstall / boot repair (2026-10-07, `docs/findings-uninstall-2026-10-07.md`, from the Workshop comments: "uninstall" was the top
  complaint, mostly a 42.20 build bricking the game after the 42.21 update): `pzopt.BootRepair` runs first in `MainScreenState.main`
  and removes (or replaces from the Workshop copy) an install built for another game revision, or finishes an in-game uninstall the
  helper left, then restarts the game (skips `scripts/pzopt.sh` installs on a mismatch; `-Dpzopt.bootRepair=false`). Every release
  leaves `Uninstall-PZ-Optimization.cmd` / `uninstall-pz-optimization.bash` and `pzopt/uninstall/install.{ps1,bash}` in the game
  folder; release assets `uninstall.ps1` / `uninstall.sh`; installers find our files without a manifest and refuse another mod's class
  unless `-Force`. Tests: `BootRepairTest`, `tests/install/install-sh-test.sh`, `harness/uninstall-e2e.sh` E-H. Windows test pending (all open Windows items: `docs/windows-test.md` "Open on Windows").
- Reflective props (2026-10-08, `docs/findings-prop-reflections-2026-10-08.md`, `mirrorsProps`, on with mirrors): 434 prop
  sprites that are not windows or mirror tiles (glass doors, store fronts, counters, cases, fridges, the glass table, screens,
  gym mirrors, steel, ceramic) reflect through pzopt.Mirrors; `harness/props/masks.py` fits each texel's face (top / south /
  east) and plane from the game's depth maps into `src/media/ui/pzopt/props/`. Flip: +107..129 us GPU in prop-dense scenes,
  tails unchanged. Lessons for every pass: on Mesa a client-memory `glTexSubImage2D` waits for the driver thread (use a PBO);
  sampling the depth buffer as a texture makes AMD decompress it (use `gl_FragDepth` / the hardware test); Mesa refuses a
  declaration before an `#extension` line (MirrorsShaderTest links with Mesa llvmpipe too).
- Open plans: `docs/plan-drive-game-thread.md` (2026-09-26: late frames while driving through town), `docs/plan-graphics-enhancements.md` (2026-09-25: visual features; items 1, 2, 4 and candidate B shipped by 2026-09-26), `docs/plan-game-load.md`, `docs/plan-vulkan-renderer.md`, `docs/plan-resource-use.md`,
  `docs/plan-zombie-multithread.md` (2026-09-22: the rest of the zombie simulation on all cores, phased).
  The game-thread optimization plans were dropped on 2026-09-21 at the maintainer's request.
- Native Wayland works via `--env JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-Dzomboid.wayland=1`; A/B on 2026-09-19 is a
  wash at the 240 cap (XWayland stays default; the NVIDIA GL worker thread only exists under
  GLX). `docs/plan-wayland.md`.
- Proton run prepared but blocked on the maintainer forcing a compat tool in Steam.
- Boot/load (2026-09-19 evening, `docs/plan-instant-load.md`): launch → menu 7.35 → 5.00 s,
  Continue → world 6.53 → 4.03 s, via boot threads (FMOD, anim sets), a boot-time file-pool
  pump, Lua precompile, animation clip + pack index caches (`~/Zomboid/pzopt/`), linear script
  parser, `Item.DoParam` switch, loader memos. First boot after a cache wipe is slower.
- Issue #1 (laptop, 2026-09-19 night): 16.5 s of its load was `Model.CreateShader` blocking on
  the render thread once per model (73 animal models × one ~220 ms loading-screen step). The
  `Model` override serves repeat shaders from `pzopt.ModelShaders` (`shaderCache`);
  `loadtime.py` row C2a shows the window. Why that laptop's loading-screen step is 220 ms is open.
