/**
 * The characters draw on the other cores ({@code charDrawPrep}, 2026-09-22).
 *
 * <p>The game-thread half of drawing a character with a 3D model ({@code FBORenderCell.renderMovingObjects} ->
 * {@code IsoGameCharacter.render} -> {@code IsoSprite.renderActiveModel}) is mostly the draw data: the model's lights for
 * this player ({@code ModelInstance.updateLights}), then {@code TextureDraw.drawModel} allocates a
 * {@code ModelSlotRenderData}, fills it from the model instance and its sub-models ({@code initModel}: one render-data
 * object and a matrix palette per body / hair / clothing model) and hands the second half ({@code init}: depth, effect
 * lights, the palette into shader parameters, attachment transforms) to the game's own eight-thread executor, one task
 * and one future per character. On the Louisville horde preset that is up to 510 characters a frame and 13 % of the
 * game thread. Between the end of the update phase and this pass nothing moves a bone, so the whole thing is built
 * ahead, in three steps hooked into {@code FBORenderCell}: {@link #walk} at the top of {@code renderInternal} hands the
 * walk of the cell's objects (the same set, the same order as the stock loop; every read is of state the update phase
 * left still) to one pool task, which keeps the on-screen ones for the sequential pass and the zombies that pass
 * the model tests that do not depend on this frame's cutaway and lighting passes; {@link #start}, right before the
 * chunk bakes (after the cutaway checks, the lighting refresh and the blacked-out passes: everything the draw data
 * reads), takes the walk's result, applies the square visibility test on the game thread, runs
 * {@code checkUpdateModelTextures} (the texture creator is game-thread work) and the lazy per-square lighting refresh
 * the model lights will read (this square, and the one above on stairs: {@code JNILighting.update} with its
 * dirty-tracking side effects, game-thread work; after it the reads are plain) and hands
 * the batch to the pass's own pool ({@code charDrawThreads} daemon threads; the game's slot-init executor has eight and
 * the batch has to finish inside the bakes) chunk by chunk, each chunk's task starting while the game thread tests the
 * next: {@code updateLights} (reads only, once the game thread refreshed the squares; the override's interpolation uses
 * thread-local scratch), {@code initModel}, {@code init} and the camera record, all on the same thread per zombie,
 * while the game thread bakes chunk textures, composites, draws the players, the corpse shadows, the world items and
 * the puddles.
 * {@link #join} at {@code renderMovingObjects} waits for the tail of it (nothing, normally), then the stock loop runs
 * over the on-screen objects: every check, the alpha rules, the fire sprites, the shadows and the enqueue order are
 * unchanged; only the {@code TextureDraw.drawModel} override finds the data ready ({@link #take}, so no future for the
 * render thread) and the {@code ModelInstance.updateLights} override sees the frame stamp and skips its second run.
 *
 * <p>What stays on the stock path: players, animals, survivors, vehicles, a fake-dead zombie (drawn from the corpse
 * atlas), a culled zombie without an active model (drawn as an atlas sprite), a zombie in a vehicle or on furniture, one
 * holding a hand model (muzzle flash and weapon transforms live in shared effect state), and everything while a debug
 * mode reads the draw data on the game thread. A zombie prepared and then not drawn (the chain's decision changed
 * between the two passes; it should not) is released the way a drawn one is: a no-op drawer goes into the sprite
 * stream so the render thread runs its {@code postRender} in order.
 *
 * <p>Thread safety, per the audit of {@code initModel} / {@code init}: the pools are synchronized, the depth helper's
 * results, the matrix pools and the shader's light scratch are thread-local (the game's own executor already runs
 * {@code init} on eight threads), every read is of state the update phase left still, the one static scratch
 * ({@code ModelInstance}'s two colours) became thread-local in the override, and a zombie is handled by exactly one
 * task, so its animation player's lazy skinning-data init and bone-index cache see one writer. What must not leave
 * the game thread: the first read of a square's light info in a pass ({@code IsoGridSquare.ILighting.lightInfo()}
 * is the lazy {@code JNILighting.update} — JNI reads plus the square's field writes and pzopt's dirty-tracking
 * hooks, which the game thread's own lazy reads during the bakes would race); {@link #start} performs that read for
 * the zombie's square and the one above it, after which the worker's {@code updateLights} only reads. A task that
 * throws turns the pass off for the session and that frame draws everything through the stock path.
