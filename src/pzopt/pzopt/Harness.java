/**
 * Hands-off benchmark driver, run on the game thread once per frame from
 * Stats.frameTick. Reads Zomboid/Lua/pzopt-harness.txt (written by
 * harness/run.sh, also read by the Lua mod that auto-continues the save).
 *
 * Keys it uses:
 *   mode     bench|parity|drive  drive the legacy route or validate and run a vehicle route; anything else: inactive
 *   route    legs      e.g. "E:600,S:600,W:600,N:600" — direction and length in tiles (drive: total distance; first leg = spawn heading)
 *   vehicle  script    drive mode: vehicle spawned on the nearest road when the player is on foot (default the race car; "none" = fixture required)
 *   kmh      km/h      drive mode: cruise-control speed (default 60); the route follows the road (roadFollow)
 *   path     x,y/x,y/… drive mode: drive this centreline instead (DrivePath, corners rounded to corner_radius, 10): the
 *                      car starts on the first point facing the second (the player is teleported there when it is far
 *                      or not loaded), DrivePilot steers and plans the speed (corners, obstacles, a stop at the last
 *                      point), the route is complete when it stops there; route= is ignored. 20 Hz telemetry in
 *                      pzopt-drive.out, drive_* lines in pzopt-bench.out; harness/drive_check.py judges the drive.
 *                      Tuning flags: see startPilot(). harness/drive-path.py builds paths from the map's streets.xml
 *   speed    tiles/s   default 18 (about car speed on a road)
 *   start    X,Y       bench/parity: teleport the player to this world square at world-ready, before the settle
 *                      time (the route then begins there). Any distance: IsoChunkMap.ProcessChunkPos unloads the
 *                      grid and reloads it around the new square, like the debug teleport. Give the streamer a
 *                      longer settle (the Louisville preset uses 20 s) so the load burst is over before the route
 *   population N|max   sandbox zombie population multipliers forced at world-ready (see Scene)
 *   turn     deg/s     bench/parity: spin the player's facing at this rate along the route so the view cone, lighting
 *                      cone and cutaways keep changing (default 0 = keep the save's facing)
 *   settle   seconds   wait after the world is up before moving (default 15; harness/run.sh passes 5: the
 *                      load burst and the forced-zoom bake are over ~2 s after the world is up)
 *   zoom     max|level  force the camera zoom before the route (auto-zoom off); drive mode defaults to max, other modes keep the save's zoom
 *   zoom_cycle secs    bench/drive: every this many seconds on the route move the target zoom one level, like one mouse-wheel
 *                      notch (the ease in MultiTextureFBO2.update runs), in to the closest level then back out; each step is a
 *                      Stats mark "zoom-<level>" (harness/zoomsteps.py aligns the frame times to them)
 *   zoom_jump  true    with zoom_cycle: set the zoom to the level at once (no ease), the worst case for the chunk-texture bakes
 *   zoom_span  N       with zoom_cycle: levels per step (default 1; 9 = the whole 0.25..2.5 range, a fast wheel spin)
 *   max_seconds        drive mode: give up (route_status=timeout) after this long on the route (default 90)
 *   ram      true      drive mode with path=: crash test (2026-09-26): no obstacle avoidance, no stop before a hard obstacle
 *                      or at the path's end, so the car hits whatever the path leads into at speed; every telemetry line
 *                      carries crashes= (BaseVehicle.crash calls, the game's "Vehicle Crash Counter"), cond= (sum of the
 *                      car's part conditions) and hp= (the driver's overall health)
 *   jitter   tiles     bench/parity, with hold: every frame of the hold the player's X alternates between the end
 *                      square's east edge minus and plus this much (e.g. 0.05), i.e. the square under the player
 *                      flips every frame, like zombies shoving a player standing on a roof edge (carport flicker rig)
 *   shot_burst N       bench/parity with hold: 1 s into the hold write N in-game screenshots on N consecutive frames,
 *                      Screenshots/pzopt-burst-NN.png (with jitter: alternating positions, frame-exact flicker checks)
 *   hold     seconds   bench/parity: after the last leg wait this long before quitting (no teleports: the player may walk); the turn
 *                      keeps spinning the facing (a still camera with changing cutaways, for flicker recordings)
 *   shot_at  seconds   bench/parity: this far into the route hold the camera (no teleport, no turn) for 6 s and,
 *                      2 s into the hold, write Zomboid/Screenshots/pzopt-shot.png (Core.TakeFullScreenshot) and
 *                      touch Zomboid/pzopt-shot.now so run.sh can take a desktop capture too (artifact checks)
 *   find     curtains  dev: at route start list the curtains within 100 tiles (type, open state, attached window,
 *                      room) so a screenshot run can be started inside such a room with start=X,Y (issue #4)
 *   find     translucent dev: at route start list the Translucent-flagged objects within 16 tiles (sprite, class, depth
 *                      flags, the floor above); with find_box=x0,y0,x1,y1 every object in that box on levels 0-2, with its
 *                      attached and overlay sprites (gas canopy lights, 2026-09-28)
 *   upstairs Z         dev: at route start move the player to the nearest loaded indoor square at level Z (issue #12)
 *   upstairs_at S      dev: with upstairs, make that move S seconds into the route instead (a Stats mark "upstairs")
 *   close_curtains true dev: at route start close every open curtain in that range through IsoCurtain.ToggleDoor
 *                      (map curtains always load open; the bench save is a copy, nothing persists)
 *   route_start_epoch  unix seconds: do not start the route before this instant (puts the route on the
 *                      schedule the external MangoHud log was configured for); absent = the route starts
 *                      settle seconds after the world is up, whenever that is
 *   mangohud_end_epoch unix seconds at which the MangoHud log closes; the game stays up until then
 *                      (a few seconds past the route end on schedule), because MangoHud only writes
 *                      its CSV if the log ends while the game runs
 *   mangohud_secs      length of the external log; when mangohud_end_epoch is absent the log is assumed to
 *                      start 3 s before the route (run.sh starts it via mangohudctl) and the linger is derived
 *
 * Whatever the flags, the instant the route will start is published as soon as the world is up in
 * Zomboid/pzopt-schedule.out (world_ready_epoch_ms, route_start_epoch_ms, log_end_epoch_ms): run.sh
 * waits for that file and times the external log and the fps-metrics reset off it. When run.sh has
 * stopped the log itself it drops Zomboid/pzopt-logdone, which ends the linger early.
 *
 * bench and parity retain the teleport control route. drive uses the vehicle's
 * normal CarController input path and completes from observed vehicle
 * displacement, so it never teleports the player or removes them from the
 * vehicle.
 *
 * Multiplayer client (GameClient.client, harness/mp/run.sh, 2026-09-21): vehicles belong to the server, so
 * drive mode leaves any vehicle the character was saved in, applies start= (MP_TELEPORT: waits for the
 * square to load), asks the server for the vehicle with the admin command "/addvehicle <script> x,y,0" on
 * the nearest road and waits for it to stream in (MP_VEHICLE, the request is repeated at 8 s because the
 * first one lands before the server has the chunk), seats the player, and turns the physics body only
 * once the client holds the vehicle's authority (MP_ALIGN; a rotation set earlier is overwritten by the
 * next VehicleUpdate). mpCleanup asks the server to remove leftover vehicles in the route corridor at the
 * start and the end of a run (the harness car included), so runs do not pile cars up at the route end.
