-- pzopt: "Optimizations" tab in the options screen, right after Display.
--  Every pzopt.Config key is a control here: booleans are tick boxes, integers are combos whose first
--  entry is the build's default on this machine. The values live in Java: the overridden
--  PerformanceSettings forwards to pzopt.Config (what is in force since boot) and pzopt.UserOptions
--  (Zomboid/pzopt/options.ini, what the next launch will read). The Optimizations tab applies on the
--  next launch, so a change away from the boot value raises the stock "restart required" dialog; the
--  Profiler tab's keys and the Enhancements tab's (entry.live) apply at once when saved (pzopt.Config.reloadLive, then
--  pzopt.Overlay.reconfigure / pzopt.Enhancements.apply).
--  A key set in the install dir's pzopt.properties or as -Dpzopt.<key> (harness runs) wins over the
--  file; its control shows that value, is disabled, and the tooltip says what pins it.
--  The top of the tab is the master switch (key `enabled`): off = every override takes its stock
--  path, the same as a build mismatch, whatever the other keys say. "Disable all (stock)" turns it
--  off; "Enable all" turns it on and puts every other control back to the build's defaults.
--  Both only change the controls; Apply / Accept saves them like any other option.
--  Right of the controls sits the preview panel (PzoptPreview, fixed while the list scrolls): for the
--  setting under the mouse it plays two clips side by side, the stock game and the optimized build on the
--  same route (animated GIFs under media/ui/pzopt/compare/, made by harness/menu-gifs.py, decoded by
--  pzopt.GifTextures), shows the setting's description and its value now / at the next launch, and draws
--  one bar per resource (game thread, render thread, other cores, GPU, VRAM, RAM, disk, load time, chunk
--  arrival) from the EFFECTS table below: left = less work / sooner, right = more. Which clip a setting
--  shows is its section's `clip`, overridden per key in KEY_CLIP.
--  Upscaling, HDR output and ambient occlusion (ENHANCEMENT_SECTIONS) have their own "Enhancements" tab right after
--  it, and the performance overlay and its game-thread profiler (PROFILER_SECTIONS) a "Profiler" tab after that, both
--  built the same way (buildSettingsPage) without the profile buttons; each has its own master switch at the top
--  (2026-09-28: `enhancementsEnabled`, `profilerEnabled`; off, Java reads the tab's feature switches as off and keeps
--  the choices saved; both live).
-- Installed by scripts/pzopt.sh into <game dir>/media/lua/client/pzopt/ (loose game-dir Lua is
-- loaded like any other, no mod to enable).

The game draws it sharp at 100 % and 50 %, soft at 75 % (a linear blur) and when zoomed out (a blend of the full picture and a blurred half-size copy: the blurry look while driving). Sharp: zoomed in, every texel of the art stays a hard square and only the one screen pixel an edge crosses is blended by how much of it the texel covers, so edges are crisp at any zoom and do not crawl while the camera glides; zoomed out, four samples per pixel from a sharper copy of the art keep fences, window frames and road lines sharp without shimmer. At 100 % the picture is the game's own. Nearest: hard pixels at every zoom-in step (75 % included), no blending. Costs next to nothing (the world picture is sampled by a variant of the same program, picked once a frame for the zoom).
